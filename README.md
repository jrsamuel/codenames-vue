Codenames with a digital gameboard

Check it out online at https://www.guesscodes.com/

I was inspired by the great project by https://github.com/jbowens/codenames

The frontend is built using Vue, Nuxt, and TailwindCSS.  Backend uses Firebase for DB and Hosting.

BTW, this is my first public repo...
